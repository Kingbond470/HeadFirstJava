Problem -2
Minimum Array Update Required

Description

You are given an array having N integer values. You are also provided an integer K. You can update every element of the array by incrementing it by 1 in 1 second. Your task is to write a program that calculates the minimum time required (in seconds) to make every element of the array greater than or equal to K.

Input

Input Format:

First line of the input contains two integer N and K

Second line contains N elements separated by space.

Constraints:

N < 100000

K < 100000

Output

Output one number, which is the minimum number of steps required to make every element of the array greater than or equal to K.
