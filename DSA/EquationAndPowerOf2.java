Problem -1
Count Possible Pairs

Description

You are given a system of equations:

x^2 + y = n

y^2 + x = m

You have to count, how many there are pairs of integers (x, y) (0 ≤ x, y) which satisfy the system.

Input

Input Format :

A single line contains two integers n, m

Constraints :

Output

On a single line print the count

Sample Input 1

9 3

Sample Output 1

1

Hint

Output Explanation :

In the first sample the suitable pair is integers (3, 0)
